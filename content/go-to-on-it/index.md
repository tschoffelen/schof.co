I've been watching some old episodes of NCIS in the background while doing some mundane admin tasks for work (only outside office hours of course!) - mostly just to have some background noise. But some of their little snippets of dialogue between the characters are pretty good...

```fountain
INT. NICS OFFICE - DAY

GIBBS
Records of the cab company?

ZIVA
Working on it!

GIBBS
DiNozzo, talk to his manager.

TONY
Go to, boss!

Gibbs stops in his tracks. McGee looks up.

GIBBS
What?

TONY
‘Go to’! It’s the new ‘on it’. New catch phase, just came up with it. You like it?

GIBBS
No - The manager?

TONY
On... it.

Tony walks towards the elevator. Gibbs turns his attention to Ziva.

GIBBS
Go...

Ziva looks confused.

GIBBS
Too!

Ziva quickly gets up from her chair, grabs her backpack and follows Tony.
