About a month or two ago, Reddit announced that they are going to start charging for their API, in a move that seems if not inspired by Twitter, very much planned with the same purpose - killing third-party apps that don't make them any revenue.

I'd been a long time user of [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/), an iPhone client for Reddit that is delightful, developed by an indie developer named Christian.

He posted tonight that he'll be shutting the app at the end of the month, after failed negotiations on pricing and timelines with Reddit. Incredibly sad, and probably my end of using Reddit.
