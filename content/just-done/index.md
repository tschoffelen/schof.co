INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JOHN and DANIELLA, both in their twenties, young souls, are in bed. Daniella is resting her head on John’s chest.

JOHN
I’m so done. I’m done.

DANIELLA
Done forever? Or just done for the day?

JOHN
I think just for the day.

DIANIELLA
Let’s start again fresh tomorrow. 

JOHN
I hope at the end of the day I’ll feel as done with everything as I feel today.

DANIELLA
Fulfilled?

JOHN
Maybe, but at the very least just done, complete, slightly complacent about all that’s left to do. I think that’s the right way to feel at the end of a day.

DANIELLA
Done.

JOHN
Just done.

Daniella moves her head from John’s chest to her pillow.

DANIELLA
Good night John.

JOHN
Good night.
