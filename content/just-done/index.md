INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JOHN and DANIELLA, both in their twenties, young souls, are in bed. Daniella is resting her head on John’s chest.

JOHN
I’m so done. I’m done.

DANIELLA
Done forever? Or just done for the day?

JOHN
I think just for the day.

DIANIELLA
Let’s start again fresh tomorrow.

JOHN
I hope at the end of tomorrow I’ll feel as done with everything as I feel today.

DANIELLA
Fulfilled?

JOHN
Maybe, but at least just done, complete, slightly complacent about all that’s left to do. I think that’s the right way to feel when the day is complete.

DANIELLA
Done.

JOHN
Just done.

Daniella moves her head from John’s chest to her pillow.

DANIELLA
Good night John.

JOHN
Good night.
