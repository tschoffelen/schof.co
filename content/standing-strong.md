Tonight I’m standing strong<br />
Like that willow tree across the street<br />
All alone on my balcony<br />
The wind moving past me<br /><br />
Gusts of cold air hitting my body<br />
I won’t move<br />
Stable on my two feet<br />
Like that willow tree across the street<br /><br />
I might text you later tonight<br />
For now I’m happy<br />
Just being here on my own<br />
Tonight I’m standing strong
