I finally decided to start learning some of the basics of vim, something that always seemed elusive to my focus. But I was also getting a bit sick of the confusing `nano` I usually use when quickly editing files from the command line.

The way I got started is using [this excellent video series](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/onramp-to-vim) from Thoughtbot called 'Onramp to Vim'. It makes it very accessible.

Along the way I also was reminded of and learned some new things to make any work in the terminal more efficient. Some that come to mind:

* Using `tmux` for terminal window management
* [Backgrounding](https://www.rockyourcode.com/suspend-vim-to-the-background-or-what-is-linux-job-control/) jobs via `Ctrl+z` (and then restoring using `fg`)

Even if I'm probably never going to start using Vim as my [main editor](https://schof.co/moving-to-visual-studio-code), it's great to feel slightly more proficient in using it.

Side note: The original author (and [benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)) of Vim was a Dutch guy named Bram Moolenaar, who sadly passed away last month. Besides his work on Vim, he was well known for his charity work with [ICCF Holland](https://www.iccf-holland.org), supporting projects in Uganda.
