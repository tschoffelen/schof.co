If you implement [in-app purchases](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/) in your app, you might want to show users a way to manage that subscription by showing links to the App Store or Google Play app. 

In native Swift, on the iOS side, there is [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/storekit/) to do this, and Android has similar APIs. If you're using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), however, you might prefer to just [deep link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking) to the right URL.

## Code example
A very simple approach to doing this looks as follows:

```js
import React from "react";
import { Button, Linking, Platform } from "react-native";

const APP_ID = "com.example.myapp";
const IAP_PRODUCT_ID = "yearly-subscription";

const ManageSubscriptionButton = () => {
	const manageSubscriptionUrl = Platform.select({
		android: `https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions?sku=${IAP_PRODUCT_ID}&package=${APP_ID}`,
		ios: "https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions",
	});
	
	return (
		<Button
			title="Manage subscription"
			onPress={() => Linking.openURL(manageSubscriptionUrl)}
		/>
	);
}
```
