I've been pretty sad about the state of the internet [lately](https://schof.co/now-that-the-trust-is-over). But it is somewhat amazing that this age of media has made it easier than ever to see what the lives of other people are like. 

I've just watched a 30 minute blog by [Tom the Taxi Driver](https://schof.co/now-that-the-trust-is-over), giving a really clear idea what a day as a cab driver is like. In another age, I'd have never learned about this most likely.

I'm spending more time watching YouTube than Netflix or Prime or TV+, specifically for that reason. Nothing else could satiate make wanting to learn about a wide variety of topics I never knew I wanted to know about, without any effort whatsoever.
