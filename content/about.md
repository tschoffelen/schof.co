  planets. I believe it's our duty to create our own meaning in life.

I believe that good software can help people provide value in society. I don't believe software has intrinsic value, only serving a value as a tool to be used by people. That's why I love creating well designed user interfaces for real people and crafting tools for developers to build better software.

Looking for something fun to do whilst waiting for my mom, a primary school teacher, to finish grading her studentsâ€™ homework, led me to start programming at age 11. 

At age 16, I co-founded my first startup [Scholica](https://infowijs.nl/?utm_source=schof.co), which primarily focussed on created learning apps for K-12 education in The Netherlands, and later became part of [Infowijs](https://infowijs.nl/?utm_source=schof.co).

After high school, I moved to London to co-found [NearSt](https://near.st/?utm_source=schof.co), a company helping thousands of local stores be found online across the world. 

I currently spend my time there building modern local commerce tools in my role as Head of Engineering, in addition to my work with [Street Art Cities](https://streetartcities.com/?utm_source=schof.co) and [Ministry of Urban Culture](https://ministryofurbanculture.com/?utm_source=schof.co), and writing about tech on my website.

I'm available for consultancy and speaking engagements for topics like serverless architecture design, product strategy, developing for open source, and more.
