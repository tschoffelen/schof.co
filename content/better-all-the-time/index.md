title: Better all the time

I’ve been extremely lucky in life so far. I’ve been given so many great opportunities, and I’ve received most of them with open arms and then ran with them. The fact that I’m here right now, having friends that know and love me, having built a great company with a team that I adore, having lived in great places and having met so many beautiful people, part of that is luck. But I think part of that, as well, is me giving nearly all I can to chase those opportunities, to use them in the best way possible, to make the most of them.

One of the reasons I am where I am right now also stems from the fact I’m never really satisfied with who I am as a human being, as a person. I can always be better. I can always be a better friend, a better family member, a better co-founder. I’ve wondered for a while if that feeling is just part of being twenty-two, being young and restless. I hope that I never change though, that I will always keep pushing myself, never start feeling content with who I am and what I’ve done.

I’m getting better all the time. 
It’s getting better all the time.
Better, better, better, all the time. ♬
