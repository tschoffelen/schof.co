I used to be the biggest Apple fanboy, watching every single keynote event live with my friends. Not so much the last couple of years. I still really like Apple, but am slightly less concerned with the intricate details, as long as they don't affect me as a developer.

I feel different about the keynote on Monday though. I don't want them to release a VR/AR headset, it doesn't make sense to me, feels completely unnecessary, but also feel like I should be aware of all the details.

I'll probably be watching live on Monday, and wonder how it will make me feel about Apple as a whole.
