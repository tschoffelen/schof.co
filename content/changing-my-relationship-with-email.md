In the last year, I've switched from a partnerships-related role to a role that solely involves engineering leadership. Together with that, it has changed how I think about a lot of tools that I use.

A simple one is my switch in task management - all my teams either use Linear or JIRA, so those issue trackers have become my main place for task management. This meant that my long history using [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) has come to an end, because my other todo list needs have changed. Todoist seemed like a more natural fit in the new workflow.

Something similar is happening with my email. Whereas before a large chunk of my day was spent in my email client, I now sometimes go whole days without opening email on my laptop. I switched to using [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com) a few years ago, and it made my email-heavy days so much more productive and less frustrating. 

It seems overkill for my current email load though, but does have some built-in features that make it hard to replace, like the amazingly fast search and offline mode, read tracking and intelligent notifications.

Recently, I've been enjoying [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com), a native Mac client specifically built on top of the Gmail API, which is very enjoyable. Once they come out with a mobile app (next year?), I might finally cancel my very expensive Superhuman subscription.
