### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Thomas.

I'm a co-founder of several tech startups, building tools to help small businesses and educators. I love consulting founders and engineers on everthing from starting their own company to architecting complex applications.

You can find my open source work in the [Includable organization](https://github.com/includable).
