### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Thomas.

I'm a co-founder of several tech startups, building tools to help small businesses and educators. I love consulting founders and engineers on everthing from starting their own company to designing complex applications.

You can find my open source work in the [flexible-agency organization](https://github.com/flexible-agency).

In my spare time I write about life, friendships, engineering and design.
